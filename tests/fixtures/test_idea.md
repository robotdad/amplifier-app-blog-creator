# Idea: The Value of Stage-Based Architecture

Quick thoughts:
- Breaking complex workflows into stages makes them easier to test
- Each stage can be developed and improved independently
- Progress visibility helps users understand what's happening
- Non-blocking architecture enables multiple interfaces (CLI, web, API)
- Clean separation between business logic and UI concerns

Example: Blog creator refactoring shows this in practice.
