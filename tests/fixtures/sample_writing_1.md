# Understanding Modular Design

When building software, we often face a fundamental challenge: how do we create systems that are both flexible and maintainable? The answer lies in modular design.

Think of it like LEGO bricks. Each piece is self-contained, but they all connect through standard interfaces. You can build anything by combining the right pieces in the right way.

The key insight is this: focus on the connections, not the pieces. When interfaces are clear and stable, you can improve individual components without breaking the whole system.

This approach scales beautifully. Small projects benefit from clarity. Large projects require it. The principles remain constant regardless of size.
