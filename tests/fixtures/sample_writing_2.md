# Simplicity as a Practice

Ruthless simplicity isn't about writing less code. It's about writing the right code.

Every line should serve a clear purpose. Every abstraction should justify its existence. When you find yourself adding complexity, pause and ask: do we actually need this?

The best systems emerge from simple, well-defined components. Trust in emergence. Don't try to control everything upfront.

This philosophy applies everywhere: architecture decisions, code organization, even documentation. Keep it simple. Keep it clear. Keep it focused.
